### Version Control Systems

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

# System that keep track of change made to files

# Also known as SCM (Source Code Management)



### Distributed VCS

## Git, Mercurial

# The full repo resides locally

# Contains full history

# Server is almost not invloved

#	Commit often and offline

#	Work on the beach / train

# Can push and pull between repos

# Back ups -trivial and readily available	



### Git basics

## Only one .git directory at the top lebel (not sprinkled throughout directory structure like SVN)




### General workflow

# (empty) Create or (existing) clone repo

# Add changes to staging area

# Commit changes (from staging area to local repo)

# Push changes from local to remote reop



### Key concept

# Commit locally

# Push remotely



### Summary

# Git lets you snapshot changes to your code

# Promotes committing change often



### Git setup

## Setup properties globally

# $git config --global user.name "Super Hero"
# $git config --global user.email my@example.com



## Verify that an option has been set

# $git config <option>

# For example $git config user.name



## getting help on any Git command

# $git help <command>
